# Work-Day-Scheduler
This assignemnt had us create a Work Day Scheduler that featured the current date/time at the top and a typical work day's timeblocks (9am-5pm) displayed underneath. Timeblocks needed to be color-coded if they were past, present, and/or future and using Javascript, we needed to implement local storage to save data to these timeblocks.
